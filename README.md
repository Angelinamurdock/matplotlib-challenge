# Matplotlib Challenge
This project is intended to analyze an animal study and use Matplotlib to generate figures to share the findings.

## Code Source
For this project, I worked with classmates, Matthew, Jenni, and Anna to work on various parts of the project. I also used previous classwork to create the code as well as ChatGPT to troubleshoot.
